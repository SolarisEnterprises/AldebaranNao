Nao python code

Choregraphe and Script
1.	Place the humanoids in the center of the field, ensuring that the Vicon returns the pose.
2.	Have them stand (you can do this with one of the predefined poses in Choregraphe).
3.	Run the code in Python (Naos.py).
4.	When prompted, grab Maecy’s left hand. Maecy will raise her arm and ask to be given the box.
5.	Do the same for Maeby.
6.	Go back to Maecy, grab her right hand. Meacy will close her fingers together in six seconds, so you have that time interval to give her the rope/box/etc.
7.	Do the same for Maeby. Once Maeby has the rope/box, they will start walking, adjusting orientation and position with respect to one another. Maecy walks to a predefined location, while Maeby follows it. When the distance between the two robots is smaller than 0.6m, they will stop and Maeby will say: “Mission accomplished.”
